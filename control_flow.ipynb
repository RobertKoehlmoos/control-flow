    "\n",
    "Although while-loops are used a lot in \"lower-level\" programming languages, they don't show up very much in Python, R, Matlab, Javascript, Go, or, well, a lot of others.  That's because they can be difficult to reason about; the reader has to look at the whole loop and keep all the steps in their head to be sure they understand the behavior and purpose of the loop itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "That's what \"For-each\" loops (in Python, just called \"For\" loops) are meant to help with.  In a \"For-each\" loop, you specify how many times the loop will occur before starting the loop, and even set the variable names you'll be using in the header.  This makes a big difference in readability!  Let's take a look:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "data = [0, 1, 2]\n",
    "for value in data:\n",
    "    print(value * 2)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "A lot of work is happening here in the for-loop.  When unpacked, this is what Python is doing;\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "data = [0, 1, 2]\n",
    "collection = iter(data)  # Create an \"iterator\" out of data, which gives the \"next\" value each time the next() function is called on it.\n",
    "\n",
    "value = next(collection)\n",

    "\n",
    "value = next(collection)\n",
    "print(value * 2)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Iterators** and **Iterables (types that can become an Iterator)** are super useful for for-loops, and there are many Python functions that make them for you.  The most important one is the **range()** function, which produces integers between two values.  For example:\n",
